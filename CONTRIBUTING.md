## We Develop with GitHub

We use github to host code, to track issues, feature requests and discussions, as well as accept pull requests.

Documentation is also hosted on GitHub pages.

## We use GitHub Flow

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
